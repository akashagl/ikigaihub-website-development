<p>The most important and basic terms that you should know in HTML are </p>


<h4>Tags</h4>

<p class="p1">The basic structure of an HTML document includes tags, which surround content and apply meaning to it.</p>

<p>
<html> is the opening tag that kicks things off and tells the browser that everything between that and the </html> closing tag is an HTML document. The content between <body> and </body> is the main content of the document that will appear in the browser window.</p>


<h4> <a href="page 2.html"> Attributes</a> </h4>

Tags can also have attributes, which are extra bits of information. Attributes appear inside the opening tag and their values sit inside quotation marks. They look something like

 <p><tag attribute="value">Margarine</tag></p>


<p>Once again, quotation marks aren’t always essential but it is a good-practice convention consistency and clarity. </p>


<p>Elements</p>

<p>Tags tend not to do much more than mark the beginning and end of an element. Elements are the bits that make up web pages. You would say, for example, that everything that is in between (and includes) the <body> and </body> tags is the body element. As another example, whereas “<title>” and “</title>” are tags, “<title>ikigai</title>” is a title element.</p>
